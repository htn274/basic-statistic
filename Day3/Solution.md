## Conditional Probability

Suppose a family has  children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?

Ans: Suppose A is an event that a family has a son, B is an event that both children are boys.
We need calculate:

$$P(A/B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{1}{3}$$

## Cards of the Same Suit

You draw 2 cards from a 52 standard-card deck without replacing them. What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?

Ans:

- To choose 2 cards from 52 cards, we have 52 * 51 ways.
- We want 2 cards that are of the same suit, so we have 52 * 12 ways.
- Result = $\frac{12}{51}$

## Drawing Marbles

A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2  marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

Ans: We suppose that A is an event that first marble is red, B is an event that second markble is blue. So that, we need calculate: 

$$P(B/A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}$$

We have:

- $P(A \cap B) = 3 \times 4$, that is the probability that first marbles is red and second marble is blue.
- $P(A) = 3 \times 6$, that is the probability that first marble must be red, we don't care about what second marbles's color.
